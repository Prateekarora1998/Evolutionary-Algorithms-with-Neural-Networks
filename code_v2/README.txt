Implementing Genetic algorithm with the bimodal distribution on Comp 1111 dataset

Brief:

#This project represents the application of the genetic algorithm on the comp 1111 dataset. This will help
us in extracting the best hyperparamaters for the neural network model formed. After extracting the
hyperparameters, we will apply those hyper parameters on the model and apply the bimodal distribution to 
the dataset to remove the outliers. These all applications will provide some useful results which can be 
analysed from my report.

Libraries that should be installed in your laptop pr pc before running the code:

# numpy()
# pandas()
# seaborn()
# matplotlib()
# torch()

Prerequisite for the file to run:

# Anaconda and python should be installed in the pc or laptop
# pytorch or torch library should be installed by using the anaconda prompt
# Run the pytorch on CUDA if you have NVIDIA graphic card. This reduces the running time of the code.
(this is optional).

How to run the code:

(As the project is implemented in windows, the instructions given in this readme file is specifically for windows user)

# Open the anaconda prompt. Locate the drive in which folder is stored
# Type "jupyter notebook" and after you press the enter you will be able to see the local host formed on
your pc or laptop.
# After that go to the location of folder and you will find ".ipynb" file.
# After opening the file, just click on the "cell" written on the top of the jupyter notebook and click on
"run all cells". In this way, you will be able to the run the code as well as you will be able to visualize 
the plots drawn for your analysis or you could press "Shift + Enter" to run the code written in every cell.
